Q1. It prints out a weird box, that according to the ASCII table, is the start of heading. For -1, we get y with the double dot over it, albeit the ASCII table saying that the value for that is 152.

Q2. It's possible -1 has some overflow property that makes it equal to the largest value it can be represented in mips.

Q3. 
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
	int i = 0;
	int value = 0;
	int input = 7;
	for (i = 0; i < input; i = i + 1){
		value = 2*value + 1;
	}
	printf("%d",value);
}

Q4. 7.
Q5. 127.
